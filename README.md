In this repo, I implement three different MCMC and use them to fit stochastic volatility model.

The stochastic volatility model is a wide family of [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_volatility). Here we consider the simplest one described in [many places](https://github.com/yinanzhu12/MCMC-SV/blob/master/reference/Bayesian%20Analysis%20of%20Stochastic%20Volatility%20Models.pdf)

$y_t=\sqrt{h_t}u_t$
